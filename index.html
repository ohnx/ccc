        <p>I do my best to ensure that all the solutions shown here are correct.
        If you notice any mistakes, please let me know. You can also submit a
        pull request to the repository <a href="https://github.com/ohnx/ccc/">here</a> and fix the problem yourself.</p>
        <p>I don't know how to solve some of the problems, so I simply don't place them here.
        If you're looking for the solutions of a problem and can't find it here,
        try taking a look at <a href="http://mmhs.ca/ccc/index.htm" target="_blank">this link</a>.</p>
